# Brief introduction
Reminisce about the old West Lake scene, enter the exploration scene, and get clues through interactive games to complete the memory puzzle. It is hoped that through the new and interesting interactive gameplay, we can help everyone understand the culture and stories of the past in the way of event restoration in the process of visiting.


## Pre-conceptual design:

 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/Lake-Remember-Moon/blob/main/picture/work.png">
</picture>
Team discussion (determine the topic, content, general form of interaction).Investigate the size of the real operation area of West Lake.Record buildings that can be marked interactively (generally choose stationary physical objects, avoid organic matter such as liquids and plants).Draw a concept map based on markers.


## Medium term:

 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/timetable.png">
</picture>

Determine the form of interaction, and the interaction of the game should not be too diverse
Determine the site
Determine the content of the situation
Delineate the division of labor (a clear division of labor can improve the speed of work, but too a single division of labor can not touch all the work processes, it is recommended that everyone experience each process, find a good and interested to continue to do.) Ôºâ


## FutureÔºö
Continue to modify and improve the plan, optimize the scene and interactive content according to the story, and continue to update the series of scenes in the case of improvement. After improving the ability, do more research to understand the needs of tourists, open up some new scenes, and may update some stronger and more immersive story scenes in the future.

The main settings of this scene are: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enter the portal - 2Ô∏è‚É£ Fish jumping interactive animation (recognize the gesture of opening five fingers üëã and wave the fish to jump out from the bottom) - 3Ô∏è‚É£ Light the three pools to trigger the fireworks effect (recognize the fireworks that appear with the tentacle gesture üëÜ, and the program recognizes the fireworks effect of the three pools of flames gathering and leaping upwards after the three devices are lit) - 4Ô∏è‚É£ Get the clue (after finding the position according to the sound volume, get the clue by pinching your fingers üëå, and the clue is the key to open the portal (out)) - 5Ô∏è‚É£ Exit the portal (after recognizing the clue, confirm the gesture üëå to open the final portal and return to the real world)


## Site:
In the design of the ground program, we according to the characters in the field scene can be active in the scope of the size of the design of a more appropriate movement path. Because our real scene path is narrower, so we need to correspondingly constrain the scope of people can walk in the scene design, skills: 1, you can use the virtual entity to cover up. 2, elevate the height of the horizon so that the user arrives at the border to feel afraid of heights.

Tips: Please experiment with your application several times and make adjustments accordingly You can place two original-sized squares stacked on top of each other in your scene (about the height and size of a person) Pre-estimate the size of your scene so that it is not too big or too small.

## HoloKit
### Hand tracking

 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure6.png">
</picture>

The "Hand Tracking Manager" requires depth information to calculate the 3D hand position, so add the "AROcclusionManager" component to the "HoloKit Camera" GameObject and adjust its settings accordingly. It is recommended to track one hand to increase the running speed.
In our project, it is mainly used in the "small fish jumping interaction".

### Gesture recognition

 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/Interaction4.PNG">
</picture>


To take advantage of gesture recognition, add a HandGestureRecognitionManager to your scene. In the project, the index finger click confirmation and two-finger pinch confirmation are mainly used to interact.
In our projects, we use them in "Lighting the Flames" and "Collecting Clues".
Tip: The gesture recognition feature is only available on devices with iOS 14.0 or later. You can use both hand tracking and gesture recognition by adding both the Hand Tracking Manager and "HandGestureRecognitionManager" components to your scene.


## Interactive technology
### Portals
Refer to the teacher‚Äôs design procedure.Mainly communicate with teachers and cooperate with GitHub Copilot.

"MainCamera" represents our coordinates in space, and the "if" statement identifies the coordinate position of "MainCamera" to determine whether the player has interacted with "Door".

### Portal working logic:

<picture>
 <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure1.png">
 <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure1.png">
 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure1.png">
</picture>

The first step is to determine the part you need to cover, distinguish the layers "in front of the door" and "behind the door", which will affect the subsequent display effect, (when you find that there is a missing object, you can go back to the layer to view, and make sure that each object is hung on the corresponding layer)

 <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure2.png">
 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure2.png">
</picture>

When you have transparent objects in your scene, you need to carefully select the three options in "Depth Texture Mode", and in most cases you can choose "After Opaques", which will affect whether the subsequent transparent objects will be visible.

 <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure8.png">
 <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure8.png">
 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure8.png">
</picture>

In our scene, because there are transparent objects and opaque objects, we hang two kinds of "Render Objects" on the layer to which each object belongs, so that both transparent and opaque objects can be displayed in one layer.


### Camera portrait display

 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure3.png">
</picture>

In order to demonstrate gesture interaction in the virtual space, we need a body mask (the "AR Occlusion Manager") to hang on the "Main Camera", and it is important to note that the mask must be hung on the smallest subset of the camera, otherwise the effect cannot be enabled.

 <img alt="YOUR-ALT-TEXT" src="https://github.com/6lihai/SUCCESS-LAKE/blob/main/picture/procedure9.png">
</picture>

The AR Occlusion Manager settings are as shown in the table, and in order to make the program on the device run quickly, it is recommended to select "Medium" for "Human Segmentation Stencil Mode" and "Fastest" for "Human Segmentation Depth Mode". Finally, select "Prefer Human Occlusion" on "Occlusion Preference Mode" to reveal the human body. If your scene has other special requirements, such as "Environment", you can select "Prefer Environment Occlusion".
